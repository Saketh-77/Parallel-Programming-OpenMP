# Parallel-Programming-OpenMP

We used OpenMP API to parallelize one of the most efficient sorting algorithms i.e., quicksort. The results turned out to be quite impressive. For an array size of (10^4) the parallelized code was 0.0036165 seconds faster than the sequential one. As for an array size of (10^5) the parallelized code was 0.9473 seconds faster than the sequential one.
